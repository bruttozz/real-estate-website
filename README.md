# Project Overview

This project is aimed to set up a website which is facing to the international students who want to find a good house to stay without wasting a lot of time search online or paying unreasonable service fees. I used Node.js to develop the back-end, Angular 8 as the front-end framework,  MongoDB as the database and Express.js as the intermediate connection.

## Development server

I will register a domain for this project, after that I will deploy it so everyone will get the access to it.
Right now it is a beta version.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
