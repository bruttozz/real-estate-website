# Project Overview

This project is aimed to set up a website which is facing to the international students who want to find a good house to stay without wasting a lot of time search online or paying unreasonable service fees. I used Node.js to develop the back-end, Angular 8 as the front-end framework,  MongoDB as the database and Express.js as the intermediate connection.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
