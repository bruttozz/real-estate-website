# Project Overview

This project is aimed to set up a website which is facing to the international students who want to find a good house to stay without wasting a lot of time search online or paying unreasonable service fees. I used Node.js to develop the back-end, Angular 8 as the front-end framework,  MongoDB as the database and Express.js as the intermediate connection.
